__b__(aeck's implementation of i) __3__ (for Windows)

## Using b3

### Using binary releases

1. Head over to the [Release](https://github.com/ritschmaster/b3/releases) page and download the latest binary zip file.
2. Decompress it somwhere
3. Execute `b3.exe`

### Using source code releases

1. Head over to the [Release](https://github.com/ritschmaster/b3/releases) page and download the latest source zip file.
2. Decompress it somwhere
3. See [Compiling](#Compiling)
4. Execute `b3.exe`

## FAQ

### How does b3 integrate into Windows?

* Your default Windows expierence stays the same. b3 lives within the Microsoft
  default Explorer shell and just adds functionalities you know and love of i3.
* Stuff like <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> is still avialable
* Switching between windows in the plain Windows way will be automatically
  recognized by b3 (e.g. switch to workspace of that window).
* The Windows 10 desktop are still available but useless when b3 is running.
* It is possible to rebind almost any key combination. <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd> is supported (for <kbd>l</kbd> see [here](https://github.com/ritschmaster/w32bindkeys#i-want-to-remap-the-win-key)

### What are the project's goals?

1. Be as i3 like as possible while integrating into default Windows as easily as possible.
2. Being stable is more important than having more features

## Compiling

### Dependencies

* [MinGW](http://mingw.org/)
* [Collections-C](https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C)
* [w32bindkeys](https://github.com/ritschmaster/w32bindkeys)

### On Windows using Msys2

You will need a functioning MinGW environment. This sections describes the compilation using [Msys2](https://www.msys2.org/).

First install the dependencies:

    pacman -S make cmake automake autoconf mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc libtool

Then compile and install Collections-C:

    wget https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    cd Collections-C-master/
    sed -i s/add_subdirectory\(test\)//g CMakeLists.txt # Testing is not needed
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

Then compile and install w32bindkeys. Please have a look at its [README](https://github.com/ritschmaster/w32bindkeys/blob/master/README.md).

Then compile b3:

    ./autogen.sh
    make

Afterwards you may install b3 - depending on your MinGW environment - by performing:

    make install

If you are unsatisfied with b3 you may uninstall it again:

    make uninstall

### On Fedora Linux (64 bit)

First install MinGW:

    sudo dnf install -y mingw64-gcc mingw64-gcc-c++ cmake automake autoconf autoconf-archive libtool

Then compile and install Collections-C:

    wget https://github.com/srdja/Collections-C/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    cd Collections-C-master/
    sed -i s/add_subdirectory\(test\)//g CMakeLists.txt # Testing is not needed
    mkdir build
    cd build
    mingw64-cmake ..
    sudo make install
    sudo cp /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib/pkgconfig/collectionc.pc /usr/lib64/pkgconfig

Then compile and install w32bindkeys. Please have a look at its [README](https://github.com/ritschmaster/w32bindkeys/blob/master/README.md).

Then compile b3:

    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig/
    ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
    make

## Version scheme

The version scheme of w32bindkeys is as follows: 1.2.3

1. Stages:
 0. Alpha
 1. Beta
 2. For Production use
2. Releases breaking compatibility of its API or the configuration file.
3. Collection of changes not breaking any compatibility.
